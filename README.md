# Chrono-OS
A fun CLI I'm making

currently **version 0.3.3**
# Stuff for you! the user! hi!!!
I DID IT!

so now you don't have to worry about the zip file

to start the program just make sure the .VIZ file and .ADMIN file have the proper permissions. then just run the .VIZ file!

make sure to post bugs in issues!
